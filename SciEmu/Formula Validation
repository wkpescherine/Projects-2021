** This section will be used to show what sections have had the formulas tested   **
** and validated. General readability will be, category, formula and if it passed **
** first with intergar, second with decimal, third is delete. Also for it to pass **
** , it must be able handle the delete and decimal for the piece of the formula   **
**                                                                                **
